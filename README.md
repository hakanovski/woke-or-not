# WOKE or NOT WOKE - Company Ideology Checker

A simple SwiftUI app that helps users check if a company aligns with woke ideology or not. Users can browse a list of companies categorized as "WOKE" or "NOT WOKE" and search for specific companies.

## Features

- **WOKE and NOT WOKE Sections**: View lists of companies that align or do not align with woke ideology.
- **Search Bar**: Search for a company to check if it’s WOKE or NOT WOKE.
- **Woke Percentage**: See how strongly each company aligns with woke ideology (in %).

## Data Structure

- **Company**: Each company has:
  - Name
  - Logo (using SF Symbols for now as placeholders)
  - Woke status (boolean)
  - Woke percentage (integer)

## Future Features

- **User Comments**: Allow users to leave comments on companies.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter companies by industry, location, or other criteria.
- **Global Companies**: Expand the database to include companies from around the world.

## Installation

1. Open the project in **Swift Playgrounds** or **Xcode**.
2. Run the app on an iOS simulator or device.

## Versioning

- **Version 1.0**: Initial version with basic features (WOKE/NOT WOKE sections and search bar).
